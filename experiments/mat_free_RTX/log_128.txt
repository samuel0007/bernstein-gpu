CMake Warning (dev) at /home/sr2120/spack/var/spack/environments/fenicsx-env/.spack-env/view/lib/cmake/dolfinx/DOLFINXConfig.cmake:49 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Environment variable BOOST_ROOT is set to:

    /home/sr2120/spack/var/spack/environments/fenicsx-env/.spack-env/view

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:59 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
